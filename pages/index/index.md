I'm interested in experimentations of all kinds with digital means.

I began my journey with a technical education. I started programming before I was ten. At the university I was heavily involved in the [robotics student organization](http://www.clubelek.fr/) and founded a [programming contest](http://codinsa.org/) for the university group.

It appeared to me that programming is just a tool, and my focus shifted toward how to use it best: project development methodologies, software quality, agile buzzwords, and rapid prototyping. I became obsessed with getting valuable results as fast as possible. Later I even organized weekly game jams where games were made within one hour.

Back in early 2010, I moved to Germany, where I discovered the digital media art movement, game jams, the [hacking spirit](https://www.ccc.de/en/home), and the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene).

As I experimented with the video game medium, I used the skills gained during the robotics years with the [alternative controllers movement](http://shakethatbutton.com/). I became member of the [artistic game collective Alineaire](http://www.alineaire.fr/).

Taking over the late DemoJS demoparty, I organize the [Cookie demoparty](http://cookie.paris/) and grow it toward a digital art festival where several communities, which are usually distinct (demoscene, indie game devs, musicians...), could be reunited.

This led me to discover the livecoding scene, and to organize [regular performative meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9e8LAhFfY1qy4R28JQ6uXU5U18T8SkPF).

I'm currently in Paris, working for Ubisoft, and occasionally giving courses.
