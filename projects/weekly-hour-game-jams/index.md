On 2017, my creativity was sleeping and I decided to take the challenge of making one game every week within one hour. This helped me learn to prioritize tasks and features.

I used [itch.io](https://itch.io/)'s jam system so that others can participate too. I stopped after 31 weeks as I couldn't take pace any further.

On the following pages, you can play participants' entries for every week, whose theme is indicated.
