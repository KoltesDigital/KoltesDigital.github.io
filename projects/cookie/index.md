From 2011 to 2014, the DemoJS demoparty put emphasis on web technologies, at a time when demoparties usually didn't consider them. Now web demos are a thing, and DemoJS has been renamed to Cookie.

The orga team is not affiliated to a specific demo group, and is composed of demosceners or digital art enthusiasts. Responsabilities are evenly distributed. I lead the organization of the demoparty, and take charge of the competitions.
